    "## The experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be taking a look at the Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation (RENO). The experiment consists of two detectors, placed at different distances from a cluster of six nuclear reactors. The smaller \"near\" detector sits around 300m from the nearest reactor, while the larger \"far\" detector is more distant at 1400m away. The near detector is used to make a prediction of what would be seen at the far detector; the difference from this is attributable to oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oscillation manifests as electron antineutrinos ($\\bar{\\nu}_e$) turning into other types (muon or tau antineutrinos) as they radiate away from the reactor. The detectors are not sensitive to these other types, so we only see the neutrinos that \"survive\" as $\\bar{\\nu}_e$. Quantum mechanically, each neutrino has a probability (called the *survival probability*) to remain as $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ , which can be expressed in a simple model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\bar\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\bar\\nu_e) = P_\\mathrm{e\\rightarrow e} = 1 - \\sin^2 \\! {2\\theta} ~ \\sin^2 \\! \\Big({1.267 \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta m^2 L}{E}} \\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(where the $1.267$ is the appropriate numerical factor if $L$ is in meters, $E$ in MeV, and $\\Delta m^2$ in eV<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>4</sup>)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can look a bit intimidating the first time you see it.  It has two sine functions in which is a bit alarming, but in practice it is not so complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first trick is that $\\theta$ is a number, a property of the neutrino system that we want to measure.  And because $\\theta$ is just a number, so too is $\\sin^2{2\\theta}$.  We can just as easily set out to measure $\\sin^2 2\\theta$ and not worry about $\\theta$, the data looks the same no matter how we describe it.  So we could instead have written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\bar\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\bar\\nu_e) = P_\\mathrm{e\\rightarrow e} = 1 - A ~ \\sin^2 \\! \\Big({1.267 \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta m^2  L}{E}} \\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and announced that we were trying to find $A$. Likewise, as used above, the cluster of symbols $\\Delta m^2$ is also just a number.  In the real experiment this is also a measurable property of neutrinos (all neutrinos, not just the ones in our experiment) that we don't know accurately and would like to measure. But for the sake of making this project fit into time, we'll just pretend that we do know it accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "So why do we the expression write it with $\\sin^2 2\\theta$ and not $A$, and $\\Delta m^2$ instead of, say, $D$?  Well, clearly they do actually mean something.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "The angle $\\theta$ is perhaps the easiest to understand.  Our electron neutrinos ($\\nu_e$) are made up of two quantum eigenstates which well call $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$:  \n",
    "    $$ \\nu_e = \\alpha_1 \\nu_1 + \\alpha_2 \\nu_2 $$\n",
    "    Although we don't know what the alphas are we <i>normalise</i> our eigenstates so that it must be that $\\alpha_1^2 + \\alpha_2^2 =1$.  This is just the equation for a point on a unit circle and we know *that* can be described by a single angle - this is $\\theta$\n",
    "    \n",
    "The $\\Delta m^2$ is a bit more tricky.  It's actually shorthand for $m_2^2 - m_1^2$,  where the $m$ are the masses of the two neutrinos. This is is in some loose sense a measure of how fast time flows for the two relativistic neutrino states $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, in their rest frames.  Or rather, it's  the difference between them. Which is weird when you remember that they are two components of the same neutrino: $\\nu_e$.  Tantalising, but relativistic quantum mechanics is a big subject, and we'll have to leave it there.  \n",

    "## Part 2:  Making some plots\n",
    "Part of this exercise is producing a good looking plot of the data. In particle physics a lot of experimental data is in the form of \"how often does some event happen as function of some other variable\". \n",
    "> This is true in many other fields as well. For example, the spectrum of a star's light is nothing more than \"how many photons are observed, as a function of the photon energy/frequency/wavelength\". But particle physics experiments are sufficiently big and expensive that you can't easily repeat a measurement. So we have to be careful about the statistical variations associated with counting things. \n",
    "\n",
    "The practical upshot is that plots of results very often take the form of a histogram.  We divide the variable of interest up into bins, and record how often events 'land' in each bin.  Do this enough and you get a distribution that should match the rate at which the events happen.  The real craft of the experimenter is making sure you understand - and can estimate quantitatively - how much your limited dataset might reasonably diverge from the measurement you would make if you had infinite time and money.  Then you can compare what you actually see to a *model* of the phenomenon and tweak the model until you get good agreement with the data, within the uncertainty imposed by your limited dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RENO experiment, the \"data\" is those events recorded from the far detector ordered by their energy, while our \"model\" is that the data will follow the predicted rate (which comes from analysing the near detector), scaled it by the survival probability, $P_{e\\rightarrow e}$.  You can see this in Figure 2 of the [journal paper](https://inspirehep.net/record/1676077) (click \"pdf\" and then \"arXiv\") we took the data from.  The first thing we will try to do is recreate (a simplified version of) this figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a histogram of the prediction\n",
    "You might rememeber making a histogram in the P2 lab (if not you can check it in `examples/p2/Exercise 08 - Data Files and Statistics`).  What we need to do this time is slightly different.  You see from the data file we actually have a summary: each line describes a single bin of the histogram.  It has the minimum and maximum edges of the bin, the number of events observed, with the error on that number, and the prediction of what to expect without applying the survival probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first make a histogram of the prediction. Looking at the [histogram documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.2/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html), PyPlot (`plt.hist`) is going to want a list of bin edges which we almost have:  `Emin` and `Emax` give us all the edges, but the first edge is only in Emin and the last is only in Emax.  So the first thing to do is combine those two lists into a single list of bin edges.  Your combined list should be one element longer than the two lists separately.  (You can do this manually by typing the new list in, but can you find a neat way to combine the two?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the list of bin edges, you need to fill them with the `PredNoOSc` values.  In P2 we filled each event as it came in, but here we just have the totals for each bin. You could perhaps just write a loop to fill each bin the right number of times, but if you look carefully this isn't going to work.  The problem is that there's a background contribution which has been estimated and subtracted off each bin (to make the problem simpler), which leaves us with fractional numbers of events(!).  Luckily, there a faster way to fill the histogram that also gets round the 'fractional events' problem. You can fill one event in the centre of each bin, but the event is *weighted* to the prediction by using the keyword argument `weights=`, which you which you can pass the prediction to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting the data points \n",
    "The actual data is plotted slightly differently.  We could plot `Data` the same way we plotted `PredNoOsc` (you can try it), but we want to show that experimental uncertainty (`DataErr`) as well.  The almost-universal convention in the field is to show the data as markers at the right height, half-way between the edges of the bin, and add error bars showing this uncertainty.  The problem is that `plt.hist` doesn't give us this option, we have to use `plt.errorbar` (find it on the [pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.2/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)).  In this case, instead of bins edges and weights, we need to give it arrays of the marker positions, and of the size of the *x* and *y* error bars.  The *x* error bars should be half the width of the bins (i.e. the distance from the centre to the edge), and the *y* error bars show `DataErr`."

    "\n",
    "Fitting can be viewed as a computational *minimization* problem. What we need is an *objective function* that describe the difference between the model and the data, and has the property that it takes large positive values when they are different and is zero when they are the same.  Let's call the model $M(x)$ where $x$ is the model parameter(s).  Then if we define an objective function $S^2(M(x))$, that gives us in effect, a function of the parameter(s) $S^2(x) = S^2(M(x))$.  Then we can just find the minimum of $S^2(x)$ (e.g. by finding where $d(S^2)/dx = 0$) and this value of $x$ will be the one where the model best matches the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few such objective functions that can be used, but the most common is the $\\chi^2$, (the Greek lower-case chi, pronounsed \"*kai*\" in English, but not in Greek), defined as\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $D_i$ and $\\sigma_i$ are the number of events in bin $i$ and its associated error, and $M_i(x)$ is the model prediction for the same bin.  We then define the model we described above: \n",

It's not too hard to write down the model $M(x)$ and the objective function $\\chi^2(x)$ as maths, but actually finding the minimum with pen and paper is a lot of differentiation that we really don't want to do.  Instead, the computer (specifically the SciPy libraries) provide ways to find a minimum, essentially by repeatedly evaluating a function at a few points and moving in the direction of the smallest one.\n",

    "The `args` argument of the minimiser function is very useful.  Although the minimiser will only search for the minimium of the objective function with respect to its first argument, you might want to pass in other parameters to a more general function.  In the example these are just to shift and scale the function, but in the case of fitting this would be a good way to supply all the data and other things you need calcualte the objective function.  The neat thing about `args=` is that you give it a tuple, so it can be used to provide any number of arguments to the objective funtion\n",

The <b>minimize_scalar</b> utility can be much faster and more reliable because it only has to search in one direction (think about looking for a dropped wallet on station platform vs looking for it on a football pitch).  \n",

    "If you're wondering how well you did, the original analysis by the RENO collaboration is [here](https://inspirehep.net/record/1676077), and you can find their answer for $\\sin^22\\theta$ (They give it labels $\\theta_{13}$ but it's basically the same angle) in the abstract.   Their full analysis also considers systematic uncertainties, which we have ignored.  But this fit uses exactly the same data so it should come out with a similar value, and a similar error.  \n",
