These *dependent variables* are the functions we take the derivatives of, and are usually what we are trying to find out.  Conversely $t$ is the *independent variable*, which is the thing we do derivatives in.  The time $t$ is by far the most common independent variable for an ODE, but if you were looking at temperature along a bar it might be a spatial co-ordinate $x$.  Spatial co-ordiantes could be dependent variables too, as in the problems we will solve below.  What matters is not what the variable represents, but the role they have (where they appear) in the derivatives.   \n",

In reality, the NASA <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19980227091\">Technical Report</a> that Katherine Johnson authored doesen't use the Euler method, although it does make use of a iterative numerical method.

    "## Part 2: Better solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "The results may not be what you expected! In particular when we try to make the step size larger, the numerical solver can become unstable: the values of $\\theta$ and $\\omega$ start following a very bumpy pattern, and eventually the solution \"blows up\" completely.  The smaller step sizes don't cause problems, but the smaller the step size, the longer it will take.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> And if step size is *too* small, problems do start to arise due to floating point accuracy in the computer: adding small numbers to a big one results in no change to the big number.  In our case all the numbers in the problem are $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, and Python uses double-precision format, which has a precision of 1 part in 10<sup>16</sup>.  However, this can become an issue if less precise formats are used and/or the problem is not carefully posed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring stability of a numerical solution becomes even more complicated with higher-order or non-linear ODEs.  In general, these problems are not trivial to solve. Luckily, we don't have to do it ourselves.  The `scipy.integrate` module has a number of utilities for dealing with numerical problems in integration, including a number of ODE solvers. A short description of how they work is given below, but as always, refer to the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.5.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)  for the function for more details. The `solve_ipv` function (\"solve initial value problem\") is what you will need to find a solution in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first have to define a function that describes our equation that we will give to the solver. Passing functions as arguments into other functions might seem weird, but it is a powerful technique, and is even the basis of some programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that we have to provide has the signature $\\mathtt{function(t,y)} = \\mathbf{\\dot{y}}(t,\\mathbf{y})$, that is to say it takes a time co-ordinate, and a (possibly array-like) variable and returns the time derivatives. If you tackled part 1 by replicating the structure of the example, you may have a function quite similar to this.  But your function probably isn't useable with this solver. Even if it does basically the same calculation, it will fail to work if it does not use the *signature* the solver utility expects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Why is that?*  Because at this low(ish) level, the computer is extremely stupid.  It doesn't know what you are trying to do, or even whether your variable names meaning anything.  All the solver knows is that it needs to feed certain numbers into the various inputs of the function, and it will get back certain other numbers in the output.  It then follows some pre-written 'rule' about where to find the numbers it should use as the first input, and what to do with the outputs to get a new input.  It's up to you make sure the function you give it has inputs and outputs in the right place (literally: the variables car converted into locations in the memory when run) so that it abides by the same rules.  This is why `scipy`  and `numpy` documentation  is so long and dry:  its essentially a detailed contract that the library code functions are written to obey.\n",

    "The **elastic force** requires a bit more care.  The cord will obey Hooke's law, i.e. $E = -kx$, where $x$ is the *extension* beyond the natural length $L$.  Unlike a spring, a bungee cord does not produce any force if it is not under tension.\n",
